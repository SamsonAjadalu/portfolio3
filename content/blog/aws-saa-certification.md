# Introduction
When I first heard about AI and machine learning, I knew how to implement some basic AI codes, but I wasn’t confident about the larger scope of its applications. I thought AI was only for large-scale, high-end projects, and that you needed advanced robotics systems or powerful computers to make it work. Through these courses, I realized that AI can be implemented on even simpler systems, like Arduino, and that I could apply AI to more accessible projects.

Before taking these courses, I dabbled in AI during internships and personal projects, but Andrew Ng’s AI For Everyone and Machine Learning Specialization opened up a whole new world for me. These courses helped me realize that AI could fit into every part of my future goals. At one point, I considered focusing on cybersecurity, but these courses made it clear that AI is my true passion. Everything I want to achieve revolves around AI, and Andrew Ng’s teaching made that even clearer.

# Reinforcement Learning: A Game Changer
One of the most impactful lessons for me was learning about reinforcement learning. Before the course, I was only familiar with supervised learning, but reinforcement learning felt like a breakthrough. For someone who has always dreamed of working with robots since childhood, this concept was a game changer. The ability to teach machines to learn from their actions and improve over time was fascinating to me, and it was exactly the kind of approach I wanted for my robotics projects.

# AI Beyond the Technical: Understanding the Broader Impact
Taking AI For Everyone expanded my understanding of AI beyond just the technical aspects. I realized that creating AI systems—or even founding an AI company—involves much more than just building models. It requires a strong understanding of the ethical considerations, business impact, and societal influence of AI. These are things I had never thought about before the course, and they have changed the way I think about AI.

I now understand the importance of ensuring that AI benefits everyone and doesn't harm any segment of society. From handling biases in data to addressing ethical concerns, I’ve learned that AI has a responsibility far beyond code.

# Applying What I Learned to My Projects
Since completing these courses, I’ve worked on several exciting AI projects. One of my favorite projects involved using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create artistic-looking dogs by combining the StyleGAN3 pretrained dog dataset with the WikiArt dataset. I trained the model to generate dog images that had an artistic style, blending real-world imagery with art.

Another significant project involved reinforcement learning. I built a robot car using a Raspberry Pi and a Jetson Nano robotic arm, combining mobility and task manipulation. By transferring what I learned from reinforcement learning models to real-life scenarios, I was able to teach the robot to perform tasks and move autonomously. These projects are just the beginning, and I’m working on more AI-driven robotics systems.

# Is This Course Right for You?
For anyone looking to break into AI, especially if you already have a basic understanding of Python syntax, these courses are perfect. The Machine Learning Specialization is ideal for beginners who want to understand how AI models work, while AI For Everyone gives a broader perspective on the business and ethical implications of AI. Together, they provide a well-rounded foundation for AI.
