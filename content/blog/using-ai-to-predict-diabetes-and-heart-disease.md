# Introduction

This project leverages machine learning models to predict diabetes and heart disease using real-world datasets. The aim is to assist in early diagnosis, which can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions.

## Modeling Approach

### Preprocessing Steps:
- **Missing Values**: Replaced missing values with feature means.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied **Polynomial Features (degree 2)** to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Scaling**: Used `StandardScaler` to normalize features for both datasets.

### Models Used:
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Logistic Regression with Regularization Parameter (C) = 100, Max Iterations = 2000.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Logistic Regression with Regularization Parameter (C) = 0.01, Max Iterations = 5000, and class weighting to handle imbalance.

### Combined Confusion Matrix:
- The confusion matrices for both the diabetes and heart disease predictions are shown below:

## Challenges and Solutions

### Diabetes Prediction:
- **Initial Accuracy**: Model achieved a training accuracy of **69.4%** and validation accuracy of **73.0%**.
- **Solution**: Applied **Polynomial Features (degree 2)** to improve complexity, resulting in **76.9%** training accuracy and **80.8%** validation accuracy.

### Heart Disease Prediction:
- **Multiclass Problem**: Initially focused on a multiclass classification approach (no disease, low, medium, high, very high risk) but achieved low cross-validation accuracy (~50%).
- **Solution**: Converted the task into a **binary classification** problem and achieved **83.6%** test accuracy and **83.0%** cross-validation accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare, specifically in early disease detection. By applying AI models, we can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing conditions like diabetes and heart disease earlier, potentially saving lives through timely intervention.

## Ethical Considerations
This project follows ethical guidelines in handling healthcare data, ensuring patient privacy and addressing biases in the datasets. Future work will involve collaborating with healthcare professionals to validate and improve the model's real-world effectiveness.
