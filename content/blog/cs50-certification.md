# Why I Took CS50
When I decided to take the CS50 course by Harvard, I had already been coding since 2017, mainly through self-taught Python tutorials on YouTube. I worked on small projects and even freelanced, using Python for automation and web scraping. I also built websites using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, something was missing—I didn’t truly understand the fundamentals of programming. While I knew how to code, I felt like I didn’t fully grasp what was happening under the hood. I needed to understand the "why" and "how" behind programming, especially the principles and mechanics that drive everything. CS50 provided that in-depth knowledge I was looking for.

I was also in need of a formal certification to back up my skills, and CS50 felt like the perfect course to take. I completed it in less than two months, dedicating six hours a day to coding while also fulfilling my NYSC responsibilities. Since I already knew the basics of coding, most of the projects weren’t too difficult for me. The course filled the gaps in my knowledge that my formal education had not covered, and it boosted my confidence significantly. 

#  Challenges I Faced
One of the most challenging aspects of the course for me was understanding data structures in C. Having worked with Python before, I was used to its built-in features like dictionaries (which function similarly to hash tables). In C, I had to manually implement a hash table, which required a deeper understanding of how data is stored and accessed in memory. Although I had learned the basics in school, diving into these structures in C during CS50 was a different and more challenging experience, significantly improving my programming skills.

# My Final Project
My final project for the course was a fitness web app called [TrainMuscleFit](https://arkalim.org/blog/aws-saa-certification). The idea behind it was to create an interactive platform that could help users plan and track their workouts and nutrition. This project was a culmination of the skills I developed throughout the course, incorporating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask. It took a few days to complete, but I ensured that everything was polished and functioning as intended.

The project felt like the perfect conclusion to my CS50 journey because it combined both the front-end and back-end skills I had learned. You can check out a demo of TrainMuscleFit [here](https://arkalim.org/blog/aws-saa-certification).

# What I Learned
CS50 taught me more than just coding—it helped me understand the concept of programming deeply. I learned C, SQL, and JavaScript, in addition to building on my existing knowledge of Python and HTML/CSS. The course gave me strong problem-solving skills and a better understanding of how to approach complex technical challenges.

After completing CS50, I jumped right into the AI Specialization with renewed confidence. I used the programming concepts I learned in CS50 to create templates for some of my AI projects. The website development skills I gained also became incredibly useful in structuring my AI projects.

# Why You Should Take CS50
If you're looking to dive into computer science or want a deeper understanding of programming, CS50 is absolutely worth it. It goes beyond just learning how to code; it gives you the knowledge of what's going on behind the scenes in your programs. Whether you're a beginner or someone like me who already had coding experience, you'll gain something valuable from the course.

#  Completion and Moving Forward
When I finally completed CS50, I felt an incredible sense of accomplishment. Receiving the certificate was a huge plus, but more than that, the course left me feeling ready to tackle even bigger programming challenges. I was excited and confident, and I knew that I had built a solid foundation in computer science that would support my future projects and career goals.!
