# Why I Took CS50
When I decided to take the CS50 course by Harvard, I had already been coding since 2017, mainly through self-taught Python tutorials on YouTube. I worked on small projects and even freelanced, using Python for automation and web scraping. I also built websites using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, something was missingâ€”I didnâ€™t truly understand the fundamentals of programming. While I knew how to code, I felt like I didnâ€™t fully grasp what was happening under the hood. I needed to understand the "why" and "how" behind programming, especially the principles and mechanics that drive everything. CS50 provided that in-depth knowledge I was looking for.

I was also in need of a formal certification to back up my skills, and CS50 felt like the perfect course to take. I completed it in less than two months, dedicating six hours a day to coding while also fulfilling my NYSC responsibilities. Since I already knew the basics of coding, most of the projects werenâ€™t too difficult for me. The course filled the gaps in my knowledge that my formal education had not covered, and it boosted my confidence significantly. 

#  Challenges I Faced
One of the most challenging aspects of the course for me was understanding data structures in C. Having worked with Python before, I was used to its built-in features like dictionaries (which function similarly to hash tables). In C, I had to manually implement a hash table, which required a deeper understanding of how data is stored and accessed in memory. Although I had learned the basics in school, diving into these structures in C during CS50 was a different and more challenging experience, significantly improving my programming skills.

# My Final Project
My final project for the course was a fitness web app called [TrainMuscleFit](https://arkalim.org/blog/aws-saa-certification). The idea behind it was to create an interactive platform that could help users plan and track their workouts and nutrition. This project was a culmination of the skills I developed throughout the course, incorporating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask. It took a few days to complete, but I ensured that everything was polished and functioning as intended.

The project felt like the perfect conclusion to my CS50 journey because it combined both the front-end and back-end skills I had learned. You can check out a demo of TrainMuscleFit [here](https://arkalim.org/blog/aws-saa-certification).

# What I Learned
CS50 taught me more than just codingâ€”it helped me understand the concept of programming deeply. I learned C, SQL, and JavaScript, in addition to building on my existing knowledge of Python and HTML/CSS. The course gave me strong problem-solving skills and a better understanding of how to approach complex technical challenges.

After completing CS50, I jumped right into the AI Specialization with renewed confidence. I used the programming concepts I learned in CS50 to create templates for some of my AI projects. The website development skills I gained also became incredibly useful in structuring my AI projects.

# Why You Should Take CS50
If you're looking to dive into computer science or want a deeper understanding of programming, CS50 is absolutely worth it. It goes beyond just learning how to code; it gives you the knowledge of what's going on behind the scenes in your programs. Whether you're a beginner or someone like me who already had coding experience, you'll gain something valuable from the course.

#  Completion and Moving Forward
When I finally completed CS50, I felt an incredible sense of accomplishment. Receiving the certificate gave me more confidence, but more than that, the course left me ready to tackle even bigger programming challenges. I was excited and confident, and I knew that I had built a solid foundation in computer science that would support my future projects and career goals..!
