# Introduction
When I first heard about AI and machine learning, I knew how to implement some basic AI codes, but I wasnâ€™t confident about the larger scope of its applications. I thought AI was only for large-scale, high-end projects, and that you needed advanced robotics systems or powerful computers to make it work. Through these courses, I realized that AI can be implemented on even simpler systems, like Arduino, and that I could apply AI to more accessible projects.

Before taking these courses, I dabbled in AI during internships and personal projects, but Andrew Ngâ€™s AI For Everyone and Machine Learning Specialization opened up a whole new world for me. These courses helped me realize that AI could fit into every part of my future goals. At one point, I considered focusing on cybersecurity, but these courses made it clear that AI is my true passion. Everything I want to achieve revolves around AI, and Andrew Ngâ€™s teaching made that even clearer.

# Reinforcement Learning: A Game Changer
One of the most impactful lessons for me was learning about reinforcement learning. Before the course, I was only familiar with supervised learning, but reinforcement learning felt like a breakthrough. For someone who has always dreamed of working with robots since childhood, this concept was a game changer. The ability to teach machines to learn from their actions and improve over time was fascinating to me, and it was exactly the kind of approach I wanted for my robotics projects.

# AI Beyond the Technical: Understanding the Broader Impact
Taking AI For Everyone expanded my understanding of AI beyond just the technical aspects. I realized that creating AI systemsâ€”or even founding an AI companyâ€”involves much more than just building models. It requires a strong understanding of the ethical considerations, business impact, and societal influence of AI. These are things I had never thought about before the course, and they have changed the way I think about AI.

I now understand the importance of ensuring that AI benefits everyone and doesn't harm any segment of society. From handling biases in data to addressing ethical concerns, Iâ€™ve learned that AI has a responsibility far beyond code.

# Applying What I Learned to My Projects
Since completing these courses, Iâ€™ve worked on several exciting AI projects. One of my favorite projects involved using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create artistic-looking dogs by combining the StyleGAN3 pretrained dog dataset with the WikiArt dataset. I trained the model to generate dog images that had an artistic style, blending real-world imagery with art.

Another significant project involved reinforcement learning. I built a robot car using a Raspberry Pi and a Jetson Nano robotic arm, combining mobility and task manipulation. By transferring what I learned from reinforcement learning models to real-life scenarios, I was able to teach the robot to perform tasks and move autonomously. These projects are just the beginning, and Iâ€™m working on more AI-driven robotics systems.

# Is This Course Right for You?
For anyone looking to break into AI, especially if you already have a basic understanding of Python syntax, these courses are perfect. The Machine Learning Specialization is ideal for beginners who want to understand how AI models work, while AI For Everyone gives a broader perspective on the business and ethical implications of AI. Together, they provide a well-rounded foundation for AI.
