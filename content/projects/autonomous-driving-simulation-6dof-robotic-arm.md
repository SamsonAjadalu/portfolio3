## Project Overview
This project simulates autonomous driving using reinforcement learning and integrates a 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) robotic arm built with a Jetson Nano. The system navigates autonomously using real-time data processing and performs precise manipulation tasks using the robotic arm.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, Servo Motors
- **Software**: ROS2, TensorFlow, Python
- **Machine Learning**: Reinforcement Learning

## Key Challenges
- Overcame challenges related to sim-to-real transfer, where the car's navigation and robotic arm's movements needed to coordinate smoothly in real-world environments.
- Tuned the reward system for the reinforcement learning model to optimize the autonomous vehicle's decision-making process.

## Results
- Achieved a 90% success rate in autonomous driving simulations.
- Successfully integrated a robotic arm that could perform tasks such as picking and placing objects while the car navigated autonomously.
