# Reinforcement Learning for Energy Optimization in Smart Home Automation

## Project Overview
Developed an AI-powered energy optimization system for my thesis titled **“Optimizing Energy Efficiency in Smart Home Automation through Reinforcement Learning and IoT”**. The goal was to address the limitations of conventional automation by designing a smart system that dynamically adapted to user behavior.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Flask, TensorFlow
- **Hardware**: ATmega328P Microcontrollers, PIR Motion Sensors, Temperature Sensors
- **Algorithms**: Reinforcement Learning, Penalty-Based Feedback Mechanism

## Key Challenges
- Overcame the challenge of ensuring reliable real-time data collection with ATmega328P microcontrollers, which initially caused delays in data processing for the reinforcement learning model.
- Faced difficulties in aligning the AI model with unpredictable user overrides that led to inefficient energy use; resolved this by implementing a penalty-based feedback mechanism to enhance the model’s adaptability.


## Results
- Achieved a **5% reduction in energy consumption** compared to conventional automation methods.
- The project was published in the **Asian Journal of Research in Computer Science**, showcasing its real-world impact and contribution to energy-efficient smart homes.
