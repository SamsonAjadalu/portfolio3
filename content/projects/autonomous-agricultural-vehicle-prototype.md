## Project Overview
Developed an Arduino-based autonomous vehicle prototype designed to monitor soil conditions and make real-time decisions about crop watering. The vehicle uses soil moisture sensors to optimize water distribution, improving farming efficiency and crop yield.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Arduino, Soil Moisture Sensors
- **Software**: Python, Arduino C
- **Data Processing**: Real-time sensor data integration

## Key Challenges
- Implemented real-time monitoring and decision-making based on sensor data to automate the irrigation process.
- Calibrated the vehicle to respond to varying soil conditions for optimized watering efficiency.

## Results
- Automated the watering process, reducing water waste and improving crop yield through data-driven decisions.
