## Project Overview
This project involved designing and developing a robotic arm prototype to assist in optimizing crop yield through real-time data and precision control. The arm is equipped with soil moisture sensors and can automate watering and other tasks in the agricultural field.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Arduino, Servo Motors, Soil Moisture Sensors
- **Software**: Python, Arduino C
- **Data Processing**: Real-time sensor data integration

## Key Challenges
- Integrated real-time sensor data to control the robotic arm, ensuring precise movements based on soil moisture levels.
- Calibrated the arm for accuracy in manipulating tools and performing agricultural tasks.

## Results
- Improved water efficiency in crop irrigation by automating the watering process based on real-time data, which led to better crop yield and reduced resource wastage.
