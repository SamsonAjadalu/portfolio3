# GANs for Artistic Image Generation

## Project Overview
This project utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate artistic images of dogs by combining real-world photos with artistic styles from the WikiArt dataset. The GANs were trained to produce high-quality, stylized images that merge art and photography.

## Technologies Used
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, StyleGAN3
- **Data**: Pretrained Dog Dataset, WikiArt Dataset
- **Techniques**: Data Augmentation, GAN Training

## Key Challenges
- Overcame mode collapse during training and optimized the balance between the generator and discriminator to ensure the production of high-quality, diverse images.

## Results
- Successfully generated realistic and artistic dog images, expanding the creative possibilities of AI-generated art.

## Future Work
- Experiment with other GAN architectures to improve output quality and style transfer capabilities.
- Apply GANs to other creative fields, such as music or video generation.
